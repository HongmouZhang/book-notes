## 4.1 Natural images patches as random vectors

1. pp. 70 the whole natural image set should be considered as a (flattend) random vector.

    > On a more theoretical level, the random vector can also represent the whole set of natural images, i.e. each observation is one natural image, in which case the database is infinitely large and does not exist in reality.

## 4.6 Expectation and covariance

1. pp. 82 Example 13. the definition of whiteness. Here, independence is required, rather than only uncorrelatedness.

## 4.8 Parameter estimation and likelihood

1. pp. 92 effect of large sample.

    > In other words, when we have a very large sample, the data outweighs the prior information. This phenomenon is related to the learning interpretation we discussed above: the organism eventually learns so much from the incoming data that the prior belief it had in the very beginning is simply forgotten.
