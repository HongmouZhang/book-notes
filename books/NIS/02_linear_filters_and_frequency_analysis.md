## 2.1 Linear filtering

Here first definition of linear filter is introduced (eq. 2.1), and then reformulated using convolution (eq. 2.5).

## 2.2 Frequency-based representation

Here an introduction of Fourier transform is given. Since the authors avoid of usage of complex numbers, the presentation here is not that standard as one would find in standard signals and systems textbooks. I advise reading a signals and systems textbook if you want details.

## 2.3 Representation using linear basis

Here the representation of an image using the orthogonal Fourier basis is introduced. Again the presentation is not standard I would say.

## 2.4 Space-frequency analysis

Here Gabor filter is introduced.

## 2.6 Exercises
