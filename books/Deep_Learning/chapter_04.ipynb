    "## 4.3 Gradient-Based Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "### pp. 86 gradient descent like procedure is used everywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Although gradient descent is limited to optimization in continuous spaces, the general concept of repeatedly making a small move (that is approximately the best small move) towards better configurations can be generalized to discrete spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### pp. 92 newton's method assumes positive definitive Hessian, which might not be true in general for Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "> As discussed in section 8.2.3, Newtonâ€™s method is only appropriate when the nearby critical point is a minimum (all the eigenvalues of the Hessian are positive), whereas gradient descent is not attracted to saddle points unless the gradient points toward them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### pp. 93 convex optimization loses popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "> However, in general, the importance of convex optimization is greatly diminished in the context of deep learning."
