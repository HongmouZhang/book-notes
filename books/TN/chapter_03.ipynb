    "in previous discussion, the score function used for classification is the firing rate itself, and we use score to compare against some threshold to make decision. By using different threshold, we get trade off between $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. However, there's possibility that we may use some other function of $r$ as score function to get better trade off of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. Here, the authors show that among all classification procedures using score function of $r$ and some threshold, likelihood ratio test is the best.\n",
