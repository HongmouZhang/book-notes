    "In the end, it says that directed tree and undirected tree encode same set of independence assertions. This is also mentioned in a more general way, in Koller's book (all moral BN is perfect map for a corresponding undirected network).\n",

    "One way to convert MRF tree to BN tree is shown, and when doing conditioning, the difference between the two become blurred. Although there are some tricks that can be used for BN, i n general, we always have to deal with the case when evidence nodes are at leaves. Check last paragraph of 4.1.2, at pp. 6.\n",

    "In the collect phase, this algorithm basically does a postorder traversal; in the distribute phase, it does a preorder traversal. See <https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/depth-first-traversals-of-binary-trees/934024358>.\n",
    "\n",
    "In pre/in/post order traversal, the pre/in/post means the relative timing between our action (here, sending message) and recursively calling other nodes. For non-binary tree, it's difficult to design an inorder traversal, as we may have varying number of children.\n",

    "\n",
    "so we convert $P(X1,X2,X3)$, into $P(X_1,X_2,X_3| W_1=1,W_2=1,W_3=1)$. Notice this is unnormalized, since $f$ is arbitrary.\n",

    "as long as it's a tree, factor algorithm is no different from sum-product. They are just efficient ways to do Elimination algorithm, doing Variable elimination more efficiently. That's all.\n",
