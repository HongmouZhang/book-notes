    "Section 4.5 of Koller's book discusses conversion between MRF and BN, as well as the loss of information during this process. They represent different sets of independence statements. Basically, the set of independence statements they are capable to enforce in their formulations are as follows.\n",

    "* pp. 139 of Koller’s book. any non triangulated loop of length at least 4 in a Bayesian network graph contains an immorality. This is true, considering the direction of arrows for all these nodes along a loop. one node must have opposing arrows coming in (otherwise can’t be a DAG), and then its two neighbors are immoral."
